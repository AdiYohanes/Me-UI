# Me-UI

Premium React Component Library with GSAP Animations.

## Description

Me-UI is a collection of high-quality, interactive React components designed to provide a premium user experience with smooth animations.

## Current Project State

- **Theme**: Beautiful Light Mode (Primary colors: White, Slate-900, Blue accents).
- **Navigation**: Simplified Header (Theme toggle removed).
- **Showcase**: Fully functional Showcase Page with component previews, code snippets, and active state management.
- **Technologies**: React, Tailwind CSS, GSAP, Lucide React.

## Maintenance Instructions (for the next AI assistant)

- **Theme Consistency**: Maintain the white/slate-50 background and slate-900 text for consistent light-mode aesthetics.
- **Component Addition**: When adding new components, ensure they are registered in `src/pages/ShowcasePage.jsx` and their source code is added to `src/data/componentSourceCodes.js`.
- **Animations**: Prefer GSAP for complex interactions and Tailwind transitions for simple state changes.
